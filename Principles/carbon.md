### Introduction

There are lots of different ways to harness energy from our natural environment. They range from sustainable sources such as the sun to unsustainable sources like carbon rich fossil fuels including coal, oil, and natural gas. Whenever we burn carbon-based fuels for energy, we release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This contributes to global warming because carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that contributes to the greenhouse effect. Understanding the impact of greenhouse gases on our environment, and the relationship between energy and carbon dioxide is key to understanding the impact that software can have on the environment.

### Greenhouse gases

Greenhouse gases (GHG) are a group of gases that trap heat from solar radiation in the Earth's atmosphere. These gases act as a blanket increasing the temperature on the surface of the Earth. Due to man-made carbon pollution, the global climate is changing much faster than animals and plants can naturally adapt. How human society will adapt is still an open question.

There are many different GHGs. The most common is carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) but we often refer to all GHGs by just saying 'carbon'. To make calculations easier we normalize all GHG numbers to carbon dioxide equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>-eq). CO<sub>2</sub>-eq is a way of measuring the impact that non-CO<sub>2</sub> gases have on global warming potential (GWP), relative to the impact of carbon dioxide. CO<sub>2</sub>-eq is most commonly measured in million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMTCDE). Different gases have different GWPs than CO<sub>2</sub> per unit of weight. CO<sub>2</sub> has a GWP of 1, since it is the gas we are normalising against. 

For example, Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), a common gaseous hydrocarbon, has a warming effect of 25 times that of CO2, so we say methane has a GWP of 25. Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), a man-made gas used as an electical insulator, has a GWP of 23,500. This means one metric tonne of SF6 released into the atmosphere is equivalent to 23,500 metric tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>. 

### COP

The COP stands for 'Conference of the Parties'. The COP is an annual event of all parties in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The COP is used to review the submitted progress of each party member and to assess the effects of measures taken by the UNFCCC on tackling global warming. The COP is also a chance for parties to come together to make decisions that will reduce the effects of global warming. Common topics include strategies to reduce carbon, financing of low-carbon strategies, and preservation of natural habitats.

### IPCC

The UN IPCC is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It is a body within the United Nations (UN). Created in 1988 the objective of the IPCC is to provide governments at all levels with scientific information that they can use to develop climate policies. IPCC reports are also a key input into international climate change negotiations. The IPCC is an organization of governments that are members of the United Nations or WMO. The IPCC currently has 195 members. [Read more about the IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/about/).

### Paris Climate Agreement

The Paris Climate Agreement is an international treaty agreed in 2015 by 196 parties and the UN to reduce the temperature increase of the Earth. The agreement is to keep the rise in global mean temperature to 2°C compared to 'pre-industrial' levels, with a 'preferable' lower limit of 1.5°C. Pre-industrial refers to a time before the industrial revolution around 1760.

The agreement is reviewed every 5 years, and also mobilises finance to developing nations in order to mitigate impacts on climate change as well as prepare for and adapt to environmental impacts caused by climate change. Each party is expected to update its progress through a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). The agreement is currently signed by 193 parties.

The temperature increase on the Earth is dependent on the total amount of carbon in the atmosphere, not the rate at which we are emitting. To completely halt the rate of temperature increase, we need to stop adding GHGs to the atmosphere or achieve net-zero emissions.

Net-zero means for each gram of CO<sub>2</sub>-eq we emit we also extract 1 gram, so the overall CO<sub>2</sub>-eq in the atmosphere remains fixed.

### Climate and Us

While weather refers to the conditions of the atmosphere in a short period of time, climate refers to the conditions of the atmosphere over long periods of time. Any changes to the long-term condition of the atmosphere will also cause changes to the short-term conditions of the atmosphere. An obvious comparison is that if the average temperature of the atmosphere increases, the average temperature of the weather in any given season will also increase. However there are myriad factors at play where this climate warming can lead to changes in weather. Some example of measurable impacts changes to weather conditions due to climate change are:

- Changes to the water cycle including rainfall
- Melting of ice
- Heating of the land, air, and ocean
- Changes in ocean currents, acidity, and salinity

The impacts of these changes may include:

- Flooding of coastal areas
- Flooding due to increased rainfall
- Drought
- More frequent extreme weather conditions
- Increased risk of wildfire

Industrial human activity is the largest contributor to climate change. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is directly proportional to the amount of human activity. The greenhouse effect from these greenhouse gases contributes to the warming of the atmosphere, and thus the changes to the climate and weather. Without intervention these changes will have catastrophic effects on the environment and planet.

### Other Sources of Greenhouse gases

Greenhouse gases and the greenhouse effect are crucial to all life on earth, and often come from natural sources like animals, volcanoes, and other geological activity. The greenhouse effect allows the earth to maintain a higher temperature than it would without greenhouse gases by capturing more heat from solar radiation. Like many other natural processes of the earth, the greenhouse effect is a finely tuned balance with multiple factors.

We also need greenhouse gases in our everyday lives. For example CO<sub>2</sub> is an important gas in many industries, including the food supply chain. The problems comes from releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere in an uncontrolled way, primarily by the burning of fossil fuels.

The earth has had many different compositions of greenhouse gases in its history, and natural fluctuation does occur over time (millennia). This is often referred to as climate change, whereas global warming is separated out as the human influenced factor which has taken place over a very short period of time (decades).

### Software and carbon

We will always emit carbon through our activities; our goal is for each gram of carbon we emit into the atmosphere to make sure we extract the most value from it as possible. To be carbon-efficient is to minimize the amount of carbon emitted per unit of work.

In the software space, the part we play in the climate solution is building applications that are carbon-efficient. Being carbon-efficient is about building applications that add the same value for you or your users, but emit less carbon.

### How to measure Greenhouse Gas emissions?

The [Greenhouse Gas Protocol](https://ghgprotocol.org) is the most widely used and internationally recognized greenhouse gas accounting standard. In fact, [92%](https://ghgprotocol.org/about-us) of all Fortune 500 companies use the GHG protocol when calculating and disclosing their carbon emissions. 

The GHG Protocol divides emissions into 3 scopes:

* Scope 1: Direct emissions from operations owned or controlled by the reporting organisation, such as on-site fuel combustion or fleet vehicles.
* Scope 2: Indirect emissions related to emission generation of purchased energy, such as heat and electricity;
* Scope 3: Other indirect emissions from all the other activities you are engaged in. Including all emissions from an organization's supply chain, business travel for employees, and the electricity customers may consume when using your product.

For many organizations Scope 3 is their most significant source of emissions and the most complex to calculate.

When it comes to software energy consumption, it might not be obvious which bucket the emissions for energy fall into. For example, if you are a mobile application developer, the energy usage of your application will fall under scope 3 since it's the end-user that actually consumes the electricity. On the other hand, if you are a cloud provider, the energy use of your virtual machines will fall under scope 2 since you are purchasing the energy.

#### Nesting Scopes

Your scope 3 emissions are the aggregate of your supplier's scope 1 and 2, and 3 emissions. If you supply another organization, your scope 1, 2 + 3 emissions form part of their scope 3 emissions.

Through this approach, it's at least theoretically possible to sum up all the GHG emissions from every organization and person in the world and reach a global total.

#### Value Chain Emissions

A value chain is a business model that describes the full range of activities needed to create a product or service. For companies that produce, say a laptop, this includes all the steps that bring a product from conception to distribution, such as procuring raw materials, manufacturing functions, and marketing activities.

Every step in this process emits carbon emissions. For example, every raw material used in the production of the laptop emitted carbon in its extraction and processing. Value chain emissions also include emissions from the use of the laptop, so the emissions from the energy used to power the laptop after it has been sold to a customer.

#### Attributional vs. Consequential

The GHG Protocol is an accounting methodology. For some organizations, the Chief Financial Officer calculates their carbon emissions.

To be an accounting methodology, everything needs to _sum up_ to a total. 

An attributional model estimates what share of the global carbon emissions belongs to a single entity. To work, the sum total of all entities needs to equal the total. There can be no double counting. Every carbon molecule is mapped 1-to-1 to a single entity in an attributional model. An accounting methodology, therefore, needs to be attributional.

A consequential model estimates the total amount of carbon reduction associated with an entity. It doesn't matter if all the potential carbon reductions add up to more carbon than the total, as there will inevitably be double counting. In a consequential model, every molecule of carbon is linked to every entity that has the capability of taking actions to remove or reduce it.

You could argue that the attributional model is more accurate, but a consequential model is more impactful. One is not better than the other; both are fit for different purposes.

[This whitepaper](https://www.watttime.org/app/uploads/2021/08/GHG-Frameworks-WhitePaper-Tomorrow-WattTime-202108.pdf) has more information regarding Attributional vs Consequential.

## Summary

Carbon is often used as a broad term to refer to the impact of our activities on global warming. The term really refers to all greenhouse gases, but the most common of these is carbon dioxide released from burning hydrocarbon fossil fuels for the generation of energy. We can use this knowledge to calculate our individual impact on global warming. It is important to understand our impact on global warming in everything we do in our life and work in order to reduce our impacts. The global community has come together to limit the impact of global warming to 2°C compared to 'pre-industrial' levels, with a 'preferable' lower limit of 1.5°C. This was agreed through the UN IPCC in 2015 in the Paris Climate Agreement.
