## Carbon

Build applications that are carbon efficient

TODO: What are GHG?

Greenhouse gases (GHG) act as a blanket increasing the temperature on the surface of the Earth. This is a natural phenomenon however due to man-made carbon pollution; the global climate is changing much faster than animals and plants can adapt. How human society will adapt is still an open question.

For more details regarding climate change’s causes and impacts read Take the Green pill and I'll show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

There are many different GHGs. The most common is carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). To make calculations easier we normalize all GHG numbers to carbon dioxide equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>-eq). For example, 1 ton of methane has the same warming effect as about 80 tons of CO<sub>2</sub>, so we normalize it to 80 tons CO<sub>2</sub>-eq. We may shorten even further to just carbon, which is a term often used to refer to all GHGs.

### What is CO<sub>2</sub>-eq?

Cabon dioxide equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>-eq) is a way of measuring the impact of gasses that are not CO<sub>2</sub> have on global warming potential (GWP), relative to the impact of carbon dioxide. Different gasses have different GWPs than CO<sub>2</sub> per unit of weight. For example, methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) - a common gaseous hydrocarbon, has a warming effect of 25 times that of CO2, so we say methane has a GWP of 25. CO<sub>2</sub> has a GWP of 1, since it is the gas we are normalising against.

Another example is sulpher hexaflouride (SF6), a manmade gas, has a GWP of 23,500. This means one metric tonne of SF6 released into the atmosphere is equivalne to 23,500 metric tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>.

CO<sub>2</sub>-eq is most commonly measured in million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMTCDE).

### What is COP

The COP stands for 'Conference of the Parties'. The COP is an annual event of all parties in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The COP is used to review the submitted progress of each party member, and to asses the effects of measures taken by the UNFCCC on tackling global warming. The COP is also a chance for parties to come together to make decisions that will reduce the effects of global warming. Common topics include stratagies to reduce carbon, financing of low carbon strategies, and preservation of natural habitats.

TODO: What is the UN IPCC

The goal set by the UN IPCC and agreed and ratified by 195 states in the Paris Climate Agreement is to reduce carbon pollution so that the temperature increase stabilises to a 1.5 °C increase by 2100.

The temperature increase on the Earth is dependent on the total amount of carbon we have in the atmosphere, not the rate at which we are emitting. To completely halt the rate of temperature increase, we need to stop adding carbon to the atmosphere or achieve net-zero emissions.

Net-zero means for each gram of carbon we emit we also extract 1 gram, so the overall mass of carbon in the atmosphere remains fixed.

In order to achieve this, we need to mobilize as a global community. We need to start immediately reducing our carbon emissions with the goal of a 45% reduction by 2030 and to reach net-zero by 2050.

To be carbon efficient is to minimize the amount of carbon emitted per unit of work.

### What was agreed in the Paris Climate Agreement? [Knowledge]

The Paris Climate Agreement is an international treaty agreed in 2015 by 16 parties and the UN to reduce the temperature increase of the Earth. The agreement is to keep the rise in global mean temperature to 2°C compared to 'pre-industrial' levels, with a 'preferable' lower limit of 1.5°C. Pre-industrial refers to a time before the industrial revolution around 1760.

The agreement is reviewed every 5 years, and also mobilises finance to developing nations in order to mitigate imapcts on climate change as well as prepare for and adapt to enivironmental impacts caused by climate change. Each party is expected to update its progress through a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). The agreement is currently signed by 193 parties.

### Do we need green house gases?

Yes. Greenhouse gasses and the greenhouse effect are crucial to all life on earth. The greenhouse effect allows the earth to maintain a higher temperature than it would without greenhouse gases by capturing more heat from solar radiation. Like many other natural processes of the earth, the greenhouse effect is a finely tuned balance.

We also need greenhouses gases in our everyday lives. For example CO<sub>2</sub> is an important gas in many industries, including the food supply chain. The problems comes from releasing greenhouses gasses into the atmosphere in an uncontrolled way, primarily by the burning of fossil fuels.

The earth has had many different compositions of greenhouse gases in its history, and natural fluctuation does occur over time (millenia). This is often refereed to as cliate change, whereas global warming is separated out as the human influenced factor which has taken place over a very short period of time (decades).
