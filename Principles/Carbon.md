### Introduction

There are lots of different ways to harness energy from our natural environment. From sustainable sources such as the sun, and unsustainable souces like carbon rich fossil fuels including coal, oil, and natural gas. Whenever we burn carbon based fuels for energy, we release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The contributes to global warming becuase carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that contributes to the greenhouse effect. Understanding the imact of greenhouse gases on our environment, and the relationshp between energy and carbon dioxide is key to understanding the imact that software can have on the environment.

### Greenhouse gases

Greenhouse gases (GHG) are a group of gases that trap heat from solar radiation in the Earth's atmosphere. These gasses act as a blanket increasing the temperature on the surface of the Earth. This is a natural phenomenon however due to man-made carbon pollution; the global climate is changing much faster than animals and plants can adapt. How human society will adapt is still an open question.

For more details regarding climate change’s causes and impacts read Take the Green pill and I'll show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

There are many different GHGs. The most common is carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). To make calculations easier we normalize all GHG numbers to carbon dioxide equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>-eq). For example, 1 ton of methane has the same warming effect as about 80 tons of CO<sub>2</sub>, so we normalize it to 80 tons CO<sub>2</sub>-eq. We may shorten even further to just carbon, which is a term often used to refer to all GHGs.

Cabon dioxide equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>-eq) is a way of measuring the impact of gasses that are not CO<sub>2</sub> have on global warming potential (GWP), relative to the impact of carbon dioxide. Different gasses have different GWPs than CO<sub>2</sub> per unit of weight. For example, methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) - a common gaseous hydrocarbon, has a warming effect of 25 times that of CO2, so we say methane has a GWP of 25. CO<sub>2</sub> has a GWP of 1, since it is the gas we are normalising against.

Another example is sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), a manmade gas used as an electical insulator, has a GWP of 23,500. This means one metric tonne of SF6 released into the atmosphere is equivalent to 23,500 metric tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>.

CO<sub>2</sub>-eq is most commonly measured in million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMTCDE).

### COP

The COP stands for 'Conference of the Parties'. The COP is an annual event of all parties in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The COP is used to review the submitted progress of each party member, and to asses the effects of measures taken by the UNFCCC on tackling global warming. The COP is also a chance for parties to come together to make decisions that will reduce the effects of global warming. Common topics include strategies to reduce carbon, financing of low carbon strategies, and preservation of natural habitats.

The UN IPCC is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It is a body within the United Nations (UN). Created in 1988 the objective of the IPCC is to provide governments at all levels with scientific information that they can use to develop climate policies. IPCC reports are also a key input into international climate change negotiations. The IPCC is an organization of governments that are members of the United Nations or WMO. The IPCC currently has 195 members. [Read more about the IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/about/).

### Paris Climate Agreement

The Paris Climate Agreement is an international treaty agreed in 2015 by 196 parties and the UN to reduce the temperature increase of the Earth. The agreement is to keep the rise in global mean temperature to 2°C compared to 'pre-industrial' levels, with a 'preferable' lower limit of 1.5°C. Pre-industrial refers to a time before the industrial revolution around 1760.

The agreement is reviewed every 5 years, and also mobilises finance to developing nations in order to mitigate impacts on climate change as well as prepare for and adapt to environmental impacts caused by climate change. Each party is expected to update its progress through a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). The agreement is currently signed by 193 parties.

The temperature increase on the Earth is dependent on the total amount of carbonin the atmosphere, not the rate at which we are emitting. To completely halt the rate of temperature increase, we need to stop adding GHGs to the atmosphere or achieve net-zero emissions.

Net-zero means for each gram of CO<sub>2</sub>-eq we emit we also extract 1 gram, so the overall CO<sub>2</sub>-eq in the atmosphere remains fixed.

### Climate and Us

Weather refers to the conditions of the atmosphere in a short period of time. Climate refers to the conditions of the atmosphere over long periods of time. Any changes to the long term condition of the atmosphere will also cause changes to the short term conditions of the atmosphere. An obvious comparison is that if the average temperature of the atmosphere increases, the average temperature of the weather in any given season will also increase. However there are myriad factors at play where this climate warming can lead to changes in weather. Some example of measurable impacts changes to weather conditions due to climate change are:

- Changes to the water cycle including rainfall
- Melting of ice
- Heating of the land, air, and ocean
- Changes in ocean currents, acidity, and salinity

The impacts of these changes may include:

- Flooding of coastal areas
- Flooding due to increased rainfall
- Drought
- More frequent extreme weather conditions
- Increased risk of wildfire

Industrial human activity is the largest contributor to climate change. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is directly proportional to the amount of human activity. The greenhouse effect from these greenhouse gasses contributes to the warming of the atmosphere, and thus the changes to the climate and weather. Without intervention these changes will have catastrophic effects on the environment and planet.

### Other Sources of Greenhouse gases

Greenhouse gasses and the greenhouse effect are crucial to all life on earth, and often come from natural sources like animals, volcanoes, and other geological activity. The greenhouse effect allows the earth to maintain a higher temperature than it would without greenhouse gases by capturing more heat from solar radiation. Like many other natural processes of the earth, the greenhouse effect is a finely tuned balance with multiple factors.

We also need greenhouses gases in our everyday lives. For example CO<sub>2</sub> is an important gas in many industries, including the food supply chain. The problems comes from releasing greenhouses gasses into the atmosphere in an uncontrolled way, primarily by the burning of fossil fuels.

The earth has had many different compositions of greenhouse gases in its history, and natural fluctuation does occur over time (millennia). This is often refereed to as climate change, whereas global warming is separated out as the human influenced factor which has taken place over a very short period of time (decades).
