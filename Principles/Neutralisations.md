### Introduction
In recent years, as the fight against global warming becomes more urgent, many economic actors are seeking to reach different climate goals by making various commitments. The terms “net zero”, “carbon neutral”, “carbon negative” and “climate neutral” have been used interchangeably with the main objective to remove, reduce and/or prevent carbon emissions. As interests for these net zero targets grow, it is also important to have a common understanding of what each of them mean and how to get there. These terms although similar, have subtle differences.
Net zero emissions refers to the overall balance of greenhouse gas emissions produced and emissions removed from the atmosphere.
Carbon neutral means that any carbon emissions resulted from a company’s activities is balanced out by an equivalent amount being removed over a specific period. This can be achieved in different ways which include carbon offsetting and reducing emissions.
Carbon negative refers to targets that go beyond achieving net zero carbon emissions by removing additional carbon from the atmosphere.
Carbon avoidance and carbon removal are example of strategies that can be employed to achieve these targets.

### Carbon Avoidance vs Carbon Removal
Between carbon avoidance and carbon removal strategies, there are numerous debate about how one strategy should be prioritised over the other. Some may also argue that we need both on the way to net-zero as there is still a huge amount of emissions left to be avoided. And there are some kinds of emissions that are unfeasible to avoid or eliminated, thus the need for removal strategies as well.

### Carbon Removal
Carbon removal, i.e. removing CO2 from the atmosphere, can take numerous forms. They range from nature based solutions, new technologies based solutions and approaches that enhance natural processes. The effectiveness of these methods are normally measured based on whether they can deliver carbon removal at the scale and speed needed. 
Some examples include:
*	Enhancing natural carbon sinks that remove CO2 from the atmosphere. For example, forest restoration since photosynthesis removes CO2 naturally. Forest expansion comes with its own challenges as it’s important to not impact the dynamics of farmland and food supply elsewhere. Modern farming methods can also prolong the time carbon remain stored in soil
* Bio-energy with Carbon Capture and Storage is the process of using biomass for energy by capturing emissions before they are released back to the atmosphere and storing them either underground or in long-lived products like concrete. It complications though lie in its dependencies on the ideal conditions being met and accounting has to be right
*	Direct Air Capture is the process of capturing CO2 from the air and storing it. This method removes excess carbon that has already been emitted directly from the atmosphere instead of capturing it at the source
*	Carbon Mineralization
*	Ocean based concepts by restoring coastal and marine habitats. This will ensure CO2 are drawn from the air


### Carbon Offsets
Carbon offsetting is the action or process to compensate GHG emissions due to organisations or individual activities via participation in programs which aims to make the equivalent carbon removal or reduction elsewhere.
In the market currently, organisations are offering carbon offset programs which enable other companies or individuals to invest in environmental projects in order to neutralise their own carbon footprint. To offset emissions, one must purchase the equivalent volume of carbon credits to compensate for them (where 1 carbon credit corresponds to 1 tonne of CO2 absorbed or reduced). These projects range from environmental conservation activities, use of renewable energy sources to efforts to remove GHG.
Types of projects in the market:
*	Reforestation and Conservation - Credits created based on carbon captured by new trees or carbon not released through protecting old trees. This is not the cheapest option but preferred due given its added benefit to protect the ecosystem and wildlife
* Renewable Energy - These projects give a boost to the number of renewable energy sources available on the grid, decrease the reliance on fossil fuels and bring about socio economic benefits like creating jobs etc.
*	Community Projects - These projects help communities around the world, particularly undeveloped ones by introducing methods of sustainable living to them via use of technology and energy-efficient methods. This indirectly empower those communities to live more sustainably and bringing in a whole load of lifestyle improvements at the same time.
*	Waste to energy - These projects involve capturing methane/landfill gas in smaller villages, human or agriculture waste and converting it into electricity. Its additional benefit impact communities the same way as Community Projects do

There are various positive benefits that stem from these projects, from ecosystem protection to empowering local communities where these projects are based, bringing a wealth of socio and economic benefits. On the flip side, if these programs are not implemented in the right way and if they do not deliver the required results, it could have a devastating impact on the whole ecosystem and the goal to reach world net zero.
Therefore, these projects must adhere to a rigorous set of criteria in order to be certified by carbon offset standards like Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and Gold Standard (GS). Across all standards, projects must meet four requirements:
*	Additionally – a project is considered additional if it results in lower carbon emissions compared to the scenario without the project. Any reductions must be measurable
*	Permanence – emission savings must be permanent, for example forestation has long-term emission storage
*	Exclusion of double counting – carbon certificates have expiries and can only be sold and credited once
*	Independent Audit – project needs to go through independent validation and verification

Carbon offset is just one way to tackle climate change and should not be considered as a standalone action. Despite the benefits from carbon offset programs, organisations and individuals should look to reduce or prevent emissions as much as possible through their own activities as well.

### Renewable Energy Certificates (REC)
A renewable energy certificate is a tradable, market-based instrument. It certifies (legally bind) that the owner owns one megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity generated from a renewable energy source. RECs can be sold on the open market as energy commodity. Once earned, it may be sold to other entities as a carbon credit to offset emissions.
It also acts as an accounting or tracking mechanism for renewable energy as they flow into the power grid. This is necessary given that electricity generated from renewable sources is indistinguishable from those produced by other sources. Unused renewable-generated electricity is fed back into the power grid while the original provider (example, roof solar panel owners) receive a REC.
RECs can also be purchased separately from electricity and independently matched with electricity consumption. Organisations in regions where renewable energy options are lacking, can purchase RECs to gain access to renewable-generated electricity without the need to change existing power contracts. It can also act as a consolidated clean energy strategy for organisations with multiple locations globally.

### Science Based Targets
With the rapid adoption of net zero targets and commitments among organisations, it has also emerged that not all targets are equal. There are inconsistencies across approaches, language used, scope and criteria.  
The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) is a global body that has developed the first global science-based standard for companies to set emissions reductions targets in line with climate science. They define and promote best practice, offering guidance and resources, developed a science-based framework for the formulation and assessment of targets to help companies move towards their net zero goals via the Net-Zero Standard.
The Net-Zero standard lay out criteria for companies to adopt science based targets which includes:
*	Achieving 90% reductions in scope 1,2 and 3 emissions before neutralising residual emissions in order to claim net zero
*	Existing science based targets set between 5-15 years are considered near term
*	Targets must cover at least two thirds of their scope 3 emissions. This is increased to 90% for long term targets
