# Introduction
Green Software Engineering is an emerging discipline at the intersection of climate science, software design, electricity markets, hardware, and data center design. The Principles of Green Software are a core set of competencies needed to define, build and run green software applications. These principles form a shared understanding of what it means to be a Green Software Practitioner independent of:

- Application domain
- Industry
- Organisation size or type
- Cloud vendor or self-hosted
- Programming language or framework

Through understanding, a Green Software Practitioner can make decisions that have a meaningful impact on the carbon pollution of their applications.

## What is Green Software?
Green Software is carbon-efficient software, which means it emits the least carbon possible. There are only three activities that reduce the carbon emissions of software; energy efficiency, hardware efficiency, and carbon awareness. This training will explain all of these concepts.

## Who should read this? 
Anyone involved in the process of building, deploying, or managing software.

## Summary
1. Carbon Efficiency: Emit the least amount of carbon possible.
2. Energy Efficiency: Use the least amount of energy possible.
3. Carbon Awareness: Do more when the electricity is cleaner and do less when the electricity is dirtier.
4. Hardware Efficiency: Use the least amount of embodied carbon possible.
5. Climate Commitments: Understand the exact mechanism of the reduction.
6. Measuring: What you can't measure, you can't improve.
