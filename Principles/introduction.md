# Introduction
Green Software Engineering is an emerging discipline at the intersection of climate science, software design, electricity markets, hardware and data centre design.The Principles of Green Software Engineering are a core set of competencies needed to define, build and run green software applications.These eight principles form a shared understanding of what it means to be a Green Software Engineer independent of:

- Application domain.
- Industry.
- Organisation size or type.
- Cloud vendor or self-hosted.
- Programming language or framework.

Through understanding, a Green Software Engineer can make decisions that have a meaningful impact on the carbon pollution of their applications.

## What is Green Software
Green Software is software that emits less carbon when running. It falls into two categories- carbon-efficient software and carbon-aware software. Green Sofware Engineer can build carbon-aware software by changing the behaviours of the software, so the software itself is responsible for emitting less carbon. On the other hand, a Green Software Engineer can build carbon-efficient software by designing software that requires less electricity and fewer machines. 

## Who should read this? 
Anyone working with technology.

## About this version 
This version of the Principles extends the knowledge on carbon, electricity, carbon intensity and embodied carbon while adding sections on neutralisations and measurement to introduce [Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) Specification](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/software_carbon_intensity). This specification describes how to calculate a carbon intensity for software applications.

## Summary
1. Carbon: Build carbon-efficient applications.
2. Electricity: Build energy-efficient applications.
3. Carbon Intensity: Consume electricity with the lowest carbon intensity.
4. Embodied Carbon: Build hardware-efficient applications.
5. Neutralisations: Remove, reduce and prevent carbon emissions. 
6. Measuring: What you can't measure, you can't improve.
