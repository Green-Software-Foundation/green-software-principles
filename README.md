# Principles of Green Software Engineering

## Scope
The original Principles of Green Software Engineering located at https://principles.green was created in 2019. As the field of Green Software Engineering (GSE) has evolved the need to update the principles has also evolved.

Specifically there is a requirement to extend knowledge in the sections on carbon, electricity, carbon intensity and embodied carbon and add sections on neutralisations as well as update the measurement section to discuss the SCI.

Taking this training will give you enough information to:
- Understand and contribute to discussions on the Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) Specification.
- Understand which features might reduce carbon emissions of your software system.
- Communicate with others regarding Green software, share a language and a dictionary.
- Defend criticism of sustainability.

## Characteristics of this training

- We assume you have no experience at all in sustainability.
- We assume you have an entry level understanding of computing. 
- This is the generic 101 training that everyone takes. It is meant for anyone in any field or sector using any computing technology. While future trainings might be created to be more specific (e.g. cloud), this training doesn't exclude anyone and is, by necessity, higher level and more generic.


## Proposed differences to V1

**Carbon** - Delve a deeper into the science of climate change so that you can defend the value of green software proposals. The purpose of GSE is not to convince people of climate change, but to provide you with the fundamentals necessary for a reasonable response to questions.

**Electricity, Carbon Intensity and Embodied Carbon** - Talk more about how you can measure each and more applicable advice for ideas for reduction.

**Networking** - Provide an extended, more accurate model. Cover topics such as:
* Streaming 
* Options for reducing network traffic (e.g. thinner APIs, low-quality streaming)
* Mobile vs. Fixed Line
* Direct DC to DC vs DC to Client

**Neutralisations** - Create a new section on the details of neutralisations, the limitations of offsets, and the differences between offsets and reductions. This section should explain terms such as net-zero and carbon neutral, as well as discuss how offsets help or hinder investment into Green Software.

**Measurement** - Discuss the SCI.

## Sections

Proposed sections should be discussed as a public GH discussion, where the group can collaborate.
